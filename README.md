AmuLib
======

> AmuLib is a small generics library I use in a lot of my Java projects.
> It contains classes for easy-to-use HTTP requests (similar to HttpFrontend for C\#),
> trees, registers for objects (external object attributes and fields), pagination and
> scrollbar classes for custom UIs, management classes to extend (I use this for module systems)
